
### Show File Size (Java)

by: Keith Fenske, https://kwfenske.github.io/

ShowFileSize is a Java 1.4 console application to print the size of each file
named on the command line in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or
terabytes. By default, sizes are in kilobytes with one digit after the decimal
point, rounded to the nearest digit. You may specify an allocation unit or
cluster size, and file sizes will be rounded up to the next full unit if
necessary.

There is no graphical interface (GUI) for this program; it must be run from a
command prompt, command shell, or terminal window.
